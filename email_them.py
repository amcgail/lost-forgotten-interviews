Subject: available for a quick chat?

Hello, <name>

I’m a graduate student in Sociology at Cornell University, studying the history of the discipline. My first paper along these lines identified the “biggest falls” in recognition to books or articles in the history of Sociology (here). I’m reaching out to you because you’ve cited many of these “remarkable deaths” throughout your career. In my database, this includes the following:

\t<paper 1 simple citation>

I’m hoping you might be able to give me some insight into why these were “forgotten.” I’m conducting “autopsies” of these, and want to talk to researchers who were close to these works.

Even a 15m conversation along these lines could be quite productive for this project, in explaining why Sociology has left these works behind. If you’re interested, use the following link to schedule an interview sometime this summer: https://calendly.com/amcgail/ontheforgotten 
I hope to speak to you soon!
